# Buddy Custom Action CLI
**Buddy Custom Action CLI** helps you scaffold Custom Actions for [Buddy](https://buddy.works). You won't have to visit the documentation website and copy the examples anymore.

## Installation and usage
This tool is very straightforward to use. Just run:
```
npx buddy-custom-action
```
and follow all the steps. In the result, you'll get a folder with the following:
- action.yml
- README.md
- a blank png image
